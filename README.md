## 🚀 Quick Start

### Running Locally

1. Open the folder in a terminal
2. Start a simple HTTP server:
   ```bash
   # Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000

   # Or Python 2
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

   # Or Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
   npx http-server
   ```
3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`
4. Press **F** for fullscreen mode before starting!

### Navigation Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: ← Previous slide, → Next slide
- **Spacebar**: Next slide
- **Click**: Advance to next slide
- **Mouse/Touch**: Use on-screen navigation buttons
- **F Key**: Toggle fullscreen
- **Home/End**: Jump to first/last slide

## 📋 Presentation Flow (15 minutes)

### Minutes 1-2: Introduction (Slides 1-2)
- Your name and connection to Fennimore
- Journey from FHS → UW Madison → IBM → Amazon → Hinge Health → Back home

**Key Message**: You don't need to leave rural Wisconsin to work for world-class companies

---

### Minutes 3-4: What is Software Engineering (Slide 3)
- Brief overview: Problem solving, building, collaboration
- Set the stage for what the career actually involves

---

### Minutes 5-7: The AI Revolution (Slides 4-5)
- Biggest change since you graduated in 2014
- Balanced view: opportunities AND reality checks
- **Critical**: Emphasize passion over prestige

**Transition**: "Let me show you how AI has changed everything..."

---

### Minutes 8-11: LIVE DEMO (Slide 6)
**This is the centerpiece!**

1. **Switch to your coding environment** (VS Code, Cursor, etc.)
2. **Start with blank files** or minimal starter
3. **Use Claude/ChatGPT in real-time** to build the Wisconsin Quiz app
4. **Narrate your process**:
   - "I'm asking Claude to create a quiz app..."
   - "Look how it generated all this HTML..."
   - "Now I'll ask it to add animations..."
   - "Oops, there's a bug - let me ask it to fix that..."

5. **Show the result** - open demo.html in browser
6. **Emphasize**: "This took 3 minutes. That's the power of modern tools."

**Pro Tips for Demo**:
- Have demo.html already built as backup (the one in this repo)
- If something breaks, don't panic - show how you debug with AI
- Keep energy high and make it conversational
- Students might have phones down - that's okay, they'll see the QR code at the end

---

### Minutes 12-13: Day in Life, Education, Salary (Slides 7-9)
- Quick run through practical info
- Remote work emphasis
- Realistic salary expectations
- Education paths (traditional and alternative)

---

### Minute 14: Inspiration & Call to Action (Slides 11-13)
- What could THEY build?
- Free resources to start TODAY
- Dream Bigger message

**Key Quote**: "You have unprecedented tools, you can work from anywhere, you can make real impact. Start with passion, not prestige."

---

### Minute 15: QR Code & Questions (Slides 14-15)
- **NOW students can take out phones**
- QR code automatically generates on slide 14
- They scan and try the quiz you just built
- Open floor for questions
- Share your contact info

## 🎨 Customization

### Update Your Info

Edit `index.html` to update:
- Your current role/company (search for "Energy Conservatory" or your current title)
- Timeline dates and events (Slide 2)
- Salary information (Slide 9) - check latest data from payscale.com or levels.fyi
- Contact information (Slide 15)

### Modify the Demo App

The `demo.html` file contains the Wisconsin Quiz. You can:
- Change questions in the `questions` array
- Adjust styling/colors
- Add more features to make it more impressive

### Adjust Timing

If you need more/less time:
- Remove slides 10 (Job Outlook) or 8 (Education) if short on time
- Add slides about specific projects you've worked on
- Adjust demo duration (aim for 3-5 minutes max)

## 🌐 Deployment Options

### Option 1: GitHub Pages (Recommended)

1. Push this repo to GitHub
2. Go to Settings → Pages
3. Set source to main branch
4. Your presentation will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/dream-bigger/`
5. QR codes will automatically work!

### Option 2: Netlify (Easy drag-and-drop)

1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Drag the entire folder onto the upload area
3. Get instant live URL
4. QR code will work automatically

### Option 3: Local presentation

- Run local server as shown above
- QR code won't work unless students are on same network
- Consider having students type URL manually or share it via email/text

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Before the Presentation

- [ ] Test everything on the actual computer/projector you'll use
- [ ] Check that QR code generates correctly (slide 14)
- [ ] Have backup demo ready in case live coding fails
- [ ] Test fullscreen mode (F key)
- [ ] Practice timing - aim for 12-13 minutes to leave time for Q&A
- [ ] Have your AI assistant (Claude/ChatGPT) ready in another window

### During the Presentation

- [ ] **Start in fullscreen mode** (press F)
- [ ] Keep energy high and conversational
- [ ] Don't rush the AI demo - it's the most memorable part
- [ ] If you make a mistake, embrace it! Show how you debug with AI
- [ ] Watch for time - slide 14 by minute 13-14
- [ ] Encourage questions throughout, not just at the end

### After the Presentation

- [ ] Stick around for 1-on-1 conversations
- [ ] Share your contact info (it's on slide 15)
- [ ] Consider following up with the school about interested students

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### QR Code Not Showing

- Check browser console for errors
- Make sure qrcodejs library loaded (check network tab)
- Fallback text with URL should still appear

### Slides Not Advancing

- Try clicking directly on the slide
- Check that JavaScript console has no errors
- Refresh the page and try again

### Demo App Not Working

- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Make sure you're running a proper HTTP server (not just opening file://)
- Use the pre-built demo.html as backup

### Animation/Styling Issues

- Some older browsers may not support all CSS features
- Chrome/Firefox/Edge recommended
- Make sure you're in fullscreen mode for best experience

## 📝 Suggested Script Snippets

### Opening (Slide 1-2)
> "Hi everyone! My name is Jake Stoeffler. I graduated from this school 15 years ago, went to UW-Madison, and now I'm back living in Fennimore - but working remotely for companies across the country. Today I want to show you what software engineering is really like, especially with the AI revolution that's happening right now."

### Before Live Demo (Slide 5)
> "So here's the thing - when I graduated in 2014, none of these AI tools existed. Now, I use them every single day. Let me show you exactly how modern software engineers work. I'm going to build a real app in the next few minutes, and you'll get to use it at the end."

### During Demo
> "I'm using Claude AI as my coding partner. Watch - I just described what I want: 'Build me a Wisconsin quiz game with multiple choice questions and score tracking.' And look at all this code it generated... Now I'll ask it to make the design better... See how we work together? I guide it, it does the heavy lifting, and I make sure everything works correctly."

### Closing (Slide 13)
> "Here's what I want you to remember: You're living in an unprecedented time. You have tools I could only dream about when I was your age. You can learn to code for free, work from anywhere, and build things that impact millions of people. But here's the key - do it because you love it, because you're curious, because you want to solve problems. Not because of the money or the 'tech bro' lifestyle. Start with passion. Dream bigger."
