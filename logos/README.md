# Company Logos

This directory should contain logo images for the timeline on Slide 2.

## Required Logo Files:

1. `uw-madison.png` - University of Wisconsin-Madison logo
2. `ibm.png` - IBM logo
3. `227labs.png` - Your consulting business logo (placeholder - replace with your actual logo)
4. `amazon.png` - Amazon logo
5. `hinge-health.png` - Hinge Health logo
6. `energy-conservatory.png` - Energy Conservatory logo

## Specifications:

- **Format**: PNG with transparent background preferred
- **Size**: Approximately 30px height (will auto-scale width)
- **Style**: Company official logos

## Where to get them:

- **Official sources**: Company websites usually have a press/media kit
- **UW-Madison**: https://brand.wisc.edu/
- **IBM, Amazon, Hinge Health, Energy Conservatory**: Search for "[company] logo png" or check their press pages

## Placeholder Option:

If you don't have time to gather all logos, you can:
1. Remove the `<img>` tags from index.html temporarily
2. Just show the text descriptions
3. The presentation will still work perfectly fine without logos

The logos are nice-to-have but not essential for the presentation!
